libgmxcpp
=========

http://github.com/wesbarnett/libgmxcpp

This is a C++ toolkit used for reading in `Gromacs <http://www.gromacs.org/>`_
files (.xtc, .ndx, and .tpr) for use in analyzing simulation results. This interfaces
with libxdrfile and the GROMACS API and implements an object-oriented style. The
main usage of the library is to be able to create a Trajectory object which
reads in an XTC file along with an optional GROMACS index file such that the
user only has to worry with implementing the actual analysis. Several functions
which are repeatedly used in Molecular Dynamics analysis (periodic boundary
condition calculations, distances, etc.) are also included. 

Advantages
----------

* Only one object construction needs to be called to read in both .xtc and .ndx
  files.
* Index groups can be used by name within the program to get a desired atom's
  coordinates.
* Custom classes for atomic coordinates and simulation box allow overloading of
  operators to simplify coding.
* Common functions such as distance, magnitude, and cross product are built-in.
* Analysis loops can easily be parallelized with class getter functions, since
  all data frames are initially read in and can be accessed simultaneously.
* No other libraries needed (the relevant parts of libxdrfile are included with
  this project).
