 * it has three items automatically when contructed. Additionally
 * one can add or subtract two sets of coordinates without having
 * to operate on each X, Y, and Z part individually. Note that the
 * coordinates can be accessed using operator[] (i.e., to get
 * the x-coordinate for a coordinates variable need coord, do coord[0]. In
 * addition, the constants X, Y, and Z have been assigned the values 0, 1, and
 * 2, respectively. So one can also access the x-coordinate with coord[X].*/
